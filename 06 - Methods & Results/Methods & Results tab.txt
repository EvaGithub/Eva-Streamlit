Methods & Results
	Pre-trained text models
		Conclusion: Best performing text model: Camembert-base

	Pre-trained vision models
		Conclusion: Best performing vision model: Google/VIT-base-patch16-224

	Multimodal experiments
	
	
	Conclusion:
		Best performing model: Separate training and fusion
			Separate training and fusion method improved results by 25%.
			Independent training reduced noise and confusion.
			Higher confidence and overall better performance.

		Separate training and fusion: Normalized confusion matrix
		    The best-performing classes are Computer Games (2905), Trading Card Games (1160), and Pool & Accessories (2583).
    		Role Playing Games (1180), Board Games (1281), and Children's Toys (1280) are frequently misclassified.
		    The model often confuses semantically similar classes.

Test set results

    Our model outperformed the benchmark, securing rank 2 on the public leaderboard.
    This confirms that our validation dataset accurately represents the real dataset.
    It also demonstrates that our model is well-generalized and not overfitted.
